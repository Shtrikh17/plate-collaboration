# Plate collaboration
Plate is a good example of WYSIWYG editor, which has a rich number of plugins and extesions. Among all the widgets personally for me collaboration was of most interest. However, current documentation provides literally nothing on deploying such functionality. This repository contains example client and server which allow to perform collaboration with cursor positions notifications.

The repository contains both client and server. Specific instructions are in each respective folder.
